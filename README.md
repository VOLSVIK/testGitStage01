### **About myself**
My desire to learn has 2 goals. First: Get an opportunity to find a job in Poland as a programmer. Second: implementation of the idea, because attempts to implement it in the WordPress system did not give the expected result, but the desire to do this does not leave me. I like to explore new things.
